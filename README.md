*React* + *Typescript* + *wallet-selector*  
Dead simple example integration of GrowthMate ad units.  

This repository contains boilerplate code for a vite react-typescript app, plus a default implementation of wallet-selector.
On top of this, minimal modifications have been made to implement our ad unis:

- We copy & pasted our `Ad.tsx` component. You can literally copy this code to your react project as is.

- We positioned the ad units on our page (see `App.tsx`). The embeds were generated by & copied from our website.
    ```tsx
    // example ad unit
    <Ad
        unitId="BADeTNAXK4MgyNsyJ1cZXQ=="
        format="200x200"
    />
    ```
